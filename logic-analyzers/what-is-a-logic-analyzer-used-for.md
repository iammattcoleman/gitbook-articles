# What Is a Logic Analyzer Used For?

* See that's going on
  * If a digital circuit is not working as expected, a logic analyzer is often the first tool used to debug potential problems. 
  * %%%screenshot of no signals%%%
* Fix timing problems
  * A logic analyzer can be used to measure the timing relationship between many different digital signals.

* Debug protocols
  * Electrical signals may initially appear acceptable, even when viewed on an oscilloscope.
  * A logic analyzer can help find issues in the communication protocol.

* Optimize power & performance
  * Toggle GPIO pins in specific sections of code to measure how long that particular section takes to run
  * %%%Code snippet with GPIO toggling%%%
* Debug interrupts & race conditions
  * Toggle GPIO pins at the entrance and exit of critical sections to investigate potential race conditions

* Debug firmware \(w/o breakpoints\)
  * Toggle GPIO pins to output debugging information
  * %%%Code snippet showing variable output to GPIO%%%
* Data-log firmware
  * Record events for long periods of time to keep a record of events in the system

* Debug analog-firmware interaction
  * If an logic analyzer supports recording analog voltages, debugging microcontroller-analog interactions is possible.
