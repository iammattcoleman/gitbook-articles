# How Does a Logic Analyzer Work?

Input is digitized: thresholds for TTL, CMOS, user-defined. 0 for low, 1 for high.

Sync \(state\) vs async \(timing\) clocking

All channels are sampled simultaneously and stored in memory

When trigger condition is met, contents in memory are displayed. Triggers can be user pushing button, single channel transition, several channel states, pattern in one or more channels.

Various tools can help the user browse through the data, search for patters, and analyze protocols.
