## What Is a Logic Analyzer, and What Is It Used For?

A logic analyzer is an instrument for capturing, displaying, and measuring multiple electronic signals simultaneously in a digital circuit. Logic analyzers are capable of showing the relationship and timing among many different signals in a digital system and are often capable of analyzing digital communication protocols, such as I2C, SPI, and Serial. As a result, a logic analyzer is the best tool for debugging digital circuits and digital communication systems.

#### History

Trying to measure signals from ICs using oscilloscopes in the 1960s

In October of 1973, the HP 5000A Logic Analyzer was released

Features and better displays were added, but logic analyzers remained large test equipment

Smaller, more powerful ICs and fast communication over USB allowed for computer-connected logic analyzers

**Operation**

* Record one or more digital signals simultaneously
  * Potentially start recording based on a trigger
  * Potentially record analog signals at the same time \(mixed-signal oscilloscope\)
* Display the signals
  * On-device or computer application
  * Store-and-display vs. real-time display
  * Navigate \(zoom, pan, etc.\)
  * %%%gif of navigating through signals%%%
* Measure the signals
  * Pulse width

  * Frequency, period, duty cycle
  * %%%screenshot of freq/period/duty cycle%%%
  * Time between events \(e.g. setup and hold time\)
  * %%%screenshot of measuring setup and hold%%%
* Search for a pattern
  * Search within previously recorded data
  * %%%screenshot of searching for pattern%%%
  * Start recording when pattern is seen \(trigger\)
* Interpret signals \(protocol analyzer\)

#### Common Uses

* See that's going on
  * If a digital circuit is not working as expected, a logic analyzer is often the first tool used to debug potential problems. 
  * %%%screenshot of no signals%%%
* Fix timing problems
  * A logic analyzer can be used to measure the timing relationship between many different digital signals.
  * %%%screenshot of measuring timing between signals%%%
* Debug protocols
  * Electrical signals may initially appear acceptable, even when viewed on an oscilloscope.
  * A logic analyzer can help find issues in the communication protocol.
