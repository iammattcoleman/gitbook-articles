## What Is a Logic Analyzer, and What Is It Used For?

A logic analyzer is an instrument for capturing, displaying, and measuring multiple electronic signals simultaneously in a digital circuit. Logic analyzers are capable of showing the relationship and timing among many different signals in a digital system and are often capable of analyzing digital communication protocols, such as I2C, SPI, and Serial. As a result, a logic analyzer is the best tool for debugging digital circuits and digital communication systems.

* Record one or more digital signals simultaneously
  * Potentially start recording based on a trigger
  * Potentially record analog signals at the same time \(mixed-signal oscilloscope\)
* Display the signals
  * On-device or computer application
  * Store-and-display vs. real-time display
  * Navigate \(zoom, pan, etc.\)
  * %%%gif of navigating through signals%%%
* Measure the signals
  * Pulse width

  * Time between events \(e.g. setup and hold time\)
